1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. Introduction and Project Goal
-----------------------------------
This document details the design, architecture, implementation, and deployment
of a decentralized Digital Identity Management System. The primary goal of this
project is to create a foundational DApp (Decentralized Application) that
allows users to associate a simple digital identity (consisting of a name and
email address) with their unique Ethereum wallet address. This identity is
recorded and managed on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, ensuring data
immutability, transparency (for public data), and user control over their
identity information.

The system aims to demonstrate core blockchain concepts such as smart contract
interactions, wallet integration, transaction signing, and decentralized data
storage for a practical use case.

1.2. Core Features
-------------------
The DApp provides the following key functionalities:

*   **Wallet Integration:** Users can connect their existing Ethereum-compatible
    wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the application. The connected
    wallet address serves as the primary identifier for the user within the
    system.
*   **Identity Registration:** A user can register a unique digital identity by
    providing their name and email. This identity is then immutably linked to
    their wallet address on the blockchain. The system prevents an address from
    registering more than one identity.
*   **Identity Update:** Users who have already registered an identity can update
    their associated name and/or email address. Only the owner of the Ethereum
    address linked to an identity can perform updates.
*   **Identity Viewing:** Any user (or external service) can query the blockchain
    to view the registered name and email associated with a given Ethereum
    address, provided an identity has been registered for that address.
*   **Decentralized Data Persistence:** All identity data is stored directly on
    the blockchain within the smart contract's storage, leveraging the
    security and immutability features of the distributed ledger.
*   **Event Emission:** The smart contract emits events upon successful identity
    registration and updates, allowing off-chain services or frontends to
    listen and react to these changes.

1.3. Technology Stack
----------------------
The project utilizes the following technologies:

*   **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum (simulated locally using Ganache)
    *   Ganache: Personal blockchain for Ethereum development, providing local
      test accounts and a simulated network environment.
*   **Smart Contract Development:**
    *   Language: Solidity (version 0.8.18)
    *   Framework: Truffle Suite (for compilation, deployment, testing, and
      artifact management)
*   **Frontend Development:**
    *   Structure: HTML5
    *   Styling: CSS3 (custom styling for a modern UI)
    *   Logic: JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   Blockchain Interaction Library: Ethers.js (version 6.x)
    *   Build Tool/Development Server: Vite
*   **Wallet Integration:**
    *   MetaMask: Browser extension acting as the user's wallet and interface
      for signing transactions and interacting with the DApp.
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment (LTS version recommended).
    *   npm (Node Package Manager): For managing project dependencies.
    *   Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is recommended with Solidity
      and JavaScript extensions.
